After sampling 300 2-dimensional data points from a 2-D normal distribution with mean [-1, 2] and SD = 2, the estimate for the mean does NOT precisely equal [-1,2], though it will be close to those values.  
To get a closer estimate:
1) we can sample a lot more points - I.e increase n (as n goes toward infinity, the estimate for the mean converges towards the true mean)
2) if we had control over the variance of the distribution, we can reduce the variance (or standard deviation) - the smaller the variance, the closer the estimate for the mean will be to the true mean.
